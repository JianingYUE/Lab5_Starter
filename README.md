1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
No, it's not the best way to test it, I can use it to test isolated parts.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
Yes, like last questtion, i can use it to test isolated parts, The test is a part of the project. so unit test is perfect.
